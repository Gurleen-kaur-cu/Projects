When I've built up my savings, I'll be able to travel to Mexico.
Wouldn't it be lovely to enjoy a week soaking up the culture?

War does not bring anything good to the common people.
If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.
Love for all,Hatred for none.
Change the world by being yourself.
Every moment is a fresh begining.
Never regret anything that made you smile.
Die with memories, not dreams.
Aspire to inspire before we expire.
Everything you can imagine is real.
Whatever you do, do it well.
Tough times never last but tough people do.
